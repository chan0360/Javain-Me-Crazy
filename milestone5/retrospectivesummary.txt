In our retrospective, we discussed what has been going well, what hasn’t, and what we could improve upon. We decided that we did the following well:
	Completion of milestones - We always complete milestones by the due date.
	Communication - We discussed the multiple avenues of communication that we use i.e. a group text message in which everyone is responsive.
	Organization - All of our project materials are on GitHub. Trello is efficient in managing sprints and goals.
	Team chemistry - We get along well.
	Problem solving - After an issue concerning our database host website, we were able to efficiently overcome the obstacle.

We have done sub-par on the following:
	Consistent database administration - The website on which we were hosting our database went out of business so we were forced to restructure the way that we manage data. A remotely accessible MySQL server should suffice. 
	Efficiency - It is difficult to efficiently manage time as several of us have part-time jobs. We also have other courses that require attention.
	Background knowledge/experience - Some of us are learning new concepts such as CSS and HTML, web scraping for data, actual structure/architecture of an aesthetic and functional website, etc. without any prior experience.

What we can improve:
	Promptness - Our plan is to begin working earlier in the week to accomplish goals set by milestones.
	Efficiency - Our plan is to host “hackathons” in which we work together as a group in order to harness the power of pair programming and teamwork.
