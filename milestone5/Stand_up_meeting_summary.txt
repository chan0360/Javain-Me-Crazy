For our stand up meeting we submitted for milestone 5 we began by discussing current issues that needed to be addressed with our project. The first of these was that the hosting we used for our database went out of business. Luckily, as we said in our video, we had the information stored in it backed up elsewhere. We discussed the solution to this problem which was hosting the database with GitHub. The pressing topic was the progress we were making on our current sprint. We talked about what needed to be done by milestone 5. The summary of that was that we need a working product to demo. In this case the product is our website. We also summarized where we are on some of the requirement we set including web scraping.

The next section of the meeting was about the logistic requirements for lab 5. This flowed well from the previous portion of the meeting because there was some overlap. The logistics were the standup meeting video and summary, the client demo, and the retrospective video with summary. We talked about who would do what to work together in meeting all of the requirements.

The final topic we discussed was the finalization of our product by the final deadline. It was decided that it would be beneficial to work over break while we are not busy. We also talked about roles going forward with who would be responsible for certain parts of the website as we go down the stretch.
