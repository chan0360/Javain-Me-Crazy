At the moment, the project has a few known bugs, and a couple of features that arent working as well as we would like them to. To start, under the Football, Mens Basketball, and Womens Basketball catagories the opponent team is displayed twice instead of just once, however there is a simple fix to this problem that simply relies on updating the php code to not do that. We recently had a bug in the campus map portion of the site that would throw an error sometimes when attempting to geocode the lat long of an address, however this problem was fixed by updating the sql database to consist of the lat long in the first place, so that the geocoding was unnecessary. As for features that we would like to improve on, we would like to get bootstrap and jquery to work a little better together in the future so that we can style our page in the way we would like to without worrying about the problems that merging the two libraries has. Also we would like to update the campus map section so that when you scroll down across the campus map and accidently place your cursor in the map or list portion that it continues scrolling instead of messing up the map or just scrolling down the page. This could be fixed by looking into the google maps api more and working out how to keep the campus map fixed instead of scrollable.
