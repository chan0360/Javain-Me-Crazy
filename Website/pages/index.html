CU Boulder has so many things happening every day it's hard to keep track of it all, and that is why our group decided to make an app that consolidates everything in one place. The app is separated into four groups: a campus map with building locations/hours, bus routes, events happening on campus, and sports scores. The idea is to have one source for all CU info that any student could need. <br>
Whether a student needs a lift from the buff bus, is looking for a snack at a grab-n-go, or is curious how well our volleyball team did last night, that student needs to go searching on google to find three separate websites that will provide the information. In fact, many students are just plainly unaware of the opportunities and events that CU hosts because the information is not readily available to them. Our app will provide a simple solution to that problem. This will become "the" app that any CU student needs to stay connected on campus.

<font size="20">Vision Statement</font><br>
<br>
1) To simplify the connection between students and Boulder organization<br>
<br>
2) Collect, compress, and convey all available relevant events and various information<br>
<br>
3) To provide a clear and constant media outlet, acquainting students to exclusive campus events, news, and day to day necessities.<br>
<br>
<font size="20">Motivation</font><br>
<br>
1) Every student deserves quick and easy access to campus news and various information, but the CU Boulder information infrastructure does not allow for that.<br>
<br>
2) The vague and limited connection between students and the University will remain a common problem until there is a common knowledge converging the interests of the two parties.<br>
<br>
3) Life consists of learning and accumulating information - some can find the time, however, most cannot; we want information exclusive to Boulder students to only be a touch away.<br>
